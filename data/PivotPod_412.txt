 hi everyone this is Pivot from New York Magazine in the VOX media podcast Network I'm Kara swisher and I'm Scott Galloway how was your weekend Scott I saw pictures I had a wonderful weekend I spoke at Expedia a few weeks ago and I mentioned on stage that we're big football fans me and my sons and they had a last-minute cancellation and they invited me to the Champions League final in Istanbul where we saw
 Inter Milan versus Man City and mice my 12 year old was just in heaven it was just in Istanbul is a wonderful City the folks from Expedia super nice it was just one of those like amazing weekends where you bomb with your son I had an absolutely
 wonderful weekend although
 anytime I put on a jersey or now talk to an executive that team will lose oh okay so I'm now infecting football I thought so yeah yeah but anyways it was an amazing weekend how was your weekend that's a big weekend for you yeah it was Alex graduated high school which was great so there was a lot going on there was a lot of Swisher activity the whole family was here and we had a great time and and the graduation was really nice and it was nice he was thrilled and then he made us go to that meat place Fogo de Chao so we had a good time and we also had lunch together he and I had lunch and also Amanda and I went on a date where we learned how to salsa dance that's right trying to keep it alive let's just stick with high school I was I I don't know about if you know much about my high school experience but I experimented with sex and drugs when I was in high school but I was part of the control group
 that's good humor that's good market research humor get it I was part of the control group because I wasn't having sex or doing drugs yeah I see that and look how well it's worked out for you yeah yeah there you go so you went on a date tell me about your date sorry oh well we went to the salsa I got her for her birthday three she loves to dance I hate to dance and you dance together we learning how to do so we had a lesson I think that should be banned in Florida I know it will be you are threatening high schools I know I know somehow gay dancing so it was good it was interesting I really don't like dancing and so it's because you don't drink is that it is that it alcohol you're affinity for alcohol and dancing are tightly quickly our is almost one there yeah I actually had a good time when I start drinking I Get Rhythm and I believe it would be unfair not to share a little Scott and I start moving and then I sober up and realize that was a bad idea
 I'll share a little Scott share a little Scott share a little Scott anyway it's a nice thing to do is a couple was a nice family weekend there is a lot going on though something that wasn't so nice is today we'll talk about Donald Trump's latest legal battle as well as a new report about the dangers of Tesla's autopilot system and why is the US government so backwards about using technology our friend of pivot has written a whole book about it and joins us with answers
 so first of all philanthropist investor George Soros is handing control of his $25 Empire to his 37 year old son Alex I think he's been ailing in an interview with the Wall Street Journal George Soros said he and his son think alike Alex Soares made the distinction that he's himself as more political than his father oh because the sorosis are get attacked rather frequently by the right the younger Soros expressed concern at another presidential run from Donald Trump and said that while money shouldn't be in politics as long as the other side is doing it we will have to do it too so now we have a younger Soros I don't know these these people are really subject to so much so many attacks when much of his stuff he does is around democracy preservation democracy I'm sorry I like George Soros I like Bill Gates I like it seems to me that the far right finds people who are hugely successful in trying to make the world a better place and find conspiracy on it yeah and I know some people who work for George Soros who worked as private Equity fun exceptionally generous exceptionally smart
 you know balls the size of fucking bowling balls and basically broke he made these huge bets
 in the 80s and 90s that could have against the pound he made just these enormous bets that paid off and then he took his billions and he is very committed to free elections and democracy and of course they're like these crazies decide that somehow
 and then let's not forget how meta financed a group or did business with a group that was circulating anti-semitic tropes about them but I I don't know anything about a son but if they're going to be billionaires I hope that they're like George Soros yeah well we'll see how well he taught him we'll see how it goes I think it's good we're gonna need all that money Alex Soros So speaking of small balls as Linda yakarino not her I think she has larger ones enters her second week is CEO of Elon Musk Twitter The Wall Street Journal is asking can Twitter's Odd Couple make it work it's a question Scott and I have definite opinions on but I love this article because they came out of the week and calling them the Mad Men meets Mad Max yakarino is still limited what she can do with advertisers through July because of her contract with NBC Universal of course this weekend Elon Musk made her job so much easier by tweeting a picture of a woman's boobs large boobs with with the quote augmented reality is amazing let's remember everyone this man is 51 years old
 that in mind but go ahead
 I don't I don't mind that I don't if Elon Musk wants to make stupid eight year old things and
 this on the scale of things he has done this does not bother me it's great for yakarino come on it's not oh it's gonna it's gonna get a lot worse for sure all right there's so this will be a literally a speeding ticket she won't even call him about this when when he starts mocking the disabled or an advertise or insulting advertisers or when massive misinformation hits this platform this is this is nothing this is literally a light a light light rain before the tornado of shitstorm she is about to she is about to enter being in business with this guy it's been a shit storm tomato for quite a while I'm just this week also which will make her life more difficult Twitter refusing to pay it's Google Cloud bill it's been trying to renegotiate the contracts and March it's a problem because it helps with the the Bots and the cease Sam that the child pornography stuff that's what they're using the Google
 allowed for so that'll be an issue I think he's he's sort of attacking the things that she needs to make it a safe place for advertisers yeah I don't I just I didn't it's gonna be really fascinating to see this play out so you what is the time frame you give her before leaving I always get stuff wrong on timing I would say it'd be six months it'll probably be 18 time goes faster than you think yeah okay I don't I think she's not the CEO
 she's been brought in as a heat shield they've passed my guess is they said look what what is her background her background is she's an incredibly talented basically Chief Revenue officer who established a strong relationship with the advertisers and Rings the register right with you know what Tim Armstrong did at Google these people are super important because they they're the ones that bring in the money and she did a great job my understanding as an MPC Universal people like her but he said he's in charge of product and strategy which basically means he's still the CEO
 she has been given an impossible task because he's going to continue to stay stupid things in alienate people and Twitter is the fastest way for a CMO to get fired the CMOS are like second lieutenant in Vietnam they last about 18 months no 18 months wow they it's a terrible job because it's never been fully defined it's usually broadened to second guess and take money out of the out of the businesses and the best CMOS service an internal Consulting Group get a lot of credibility such that it's a pull but usually what they do is they show up and they start heckling from the cheap seats about the different business units how they should you know be treating the brand and the people who actually run the businesses and make the money have the power and at some point get fed up the CMO and start complaining the CEO and the CMO is out it is a very difficult job I'm not even sure the CMO Position will exist in 10 to 20 years right they like to throw parties though well they're fun and that's again relationships right it's my guess is she's been tasked with with restrening or or reestablishing relationships with key advertisers
 then getting them to spend my guess is she'll get some people who will just write a check out of loyalty to her on a risk adjusted basis this is the worst media spend in the world yeah
 hundred percent anyway we'll see because there are other businesses aren't doing great they're reportedly under 500,000 Twitter blue users if that's the correct number so I think one of the things that that they're trying to do is is pay users for ads in their replies by the way ads have been noticeably terrible on Twitter of late but Elon noted the Creator must be verified and only add served to verified users count and so they're gonna try to do that more tricks more tiny little tricks so Apple gets an unbelievable price premium because the brands that get the biggest price premium or have the biggest margins have usually self-expressive benefit it says something about you when you graduated from Dartmouth and so as a result they're able to charge 90% gross margins the costs the class cost $700 to deliver we charge $7,000 for it at an elite University apple is 550 bucks of chipsets and sensors they charge 1100 bucks for it because it says you're one of the 1 billion wealthiest
 people on the planet in the best storytellers the Panerai says you're Italian and masculine these things whenever there's huge margin it has self-expressive benefit the blue check had self-expressive benefit it's said that you had achieved a certain level of influence and credibility now what it says it's the equivalent of a magahet
 when I look at my comments the ones that are most aggressive around should posting Biden or push back on me whenever I say anything about it's all blue checks and it's he has aggregated eat like the Elon stands tend to be more conservative
 and it's now the selfish it's it's the opposite of self-expressive benefit it is literally like it's that Larry David show to putting on a mega hat it says you're very conservative
 quite frankly the comments I get from people with blue checks tend not to be that thoughtful I put out a post on
 no mercy No Malice about the mixed reality headset and on the comments on Prof gallery.com underneath the newsletter we're really thoughtful and interesting and a lot of very thoughtful and civil pushback the CEO of cloudflare said you're not thinking about this right there's opportunities here here and here my old business partners at Scott wouldn't you pay this money to have a 4K screen with you wherever you are a 4k monitor people talked about all kinds of B2B applications and I started thinking wow there's real Merit here I should be I should be open to this stuff you go on Twitter and people are just it's totally irresponsible to assess something without having even tried it and yet their feed is talking it up I'm like have you tried it show me an emotional reaction where you're not able to separate a business issue and a political issue from the person and instead of talking about the issue you start attacking the person and I'm gonna show you a blue check yeah I still can't get rid of my blue check I keep trying but it doesn't go off
 so they can give it to you and you can opt out of it I can't I can't get off of it I can't take it off because I'm you know I just can't take it off
 I've tried all the little ways I'll keep trying the different things people suggest to me but I can't get rid of it but I'm certainly not paying for it anyway we'll see where it goes another piece of news with Elon actually weighed in on the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski has died in prison of a parent's suicide and Elon tweeted that the domestic terrorist quote might not have been wrong about technology being detrimental Society I think Elon Musk is detrimental side at this point but he was found unresponsive in medical facility in prison where he was serving life sentence this is someone just so people are aware of who he's thinking is Right spent 20 years terrorizing victims of the homemade bomb sent through the mail by the time he was caught three people had died in 24 were injured some rather severely so great guy to back I don't know seems like he was a math he was a math prodigy obviously lost his way brother significantly you know if you you remember that Unabomber stuff God that was seared into my memory at the time it's kind of a fascinating care you know he went to Harvard when he was 16 he did yeah and
 don't like to talk or reference his Manifesto or what he believed because I don't I don't want to bring any attention to it
 and I believe a decent proxy for your success as a person in your life is if you die
 under Bright Lights surrounded by strangers you have failed if you figure out a way to die at home or you know with people who love you surrounding you you've won and I like the fact that this man died alone and I I he maimed 204 people 24 yeah cause terror kill three people and and killed three people I mean the amount of misery that he caused so my feeling is it's unimportant what he stood for I have no desire to examine it or bring any attention to it this is this was someone who was a terrorist who died alone and whose life was so awful he he spent all of his time and energy trying to figure out how to kill himself
 and so you know I hope my guess is I don't believe there is a hell but my guess is he's sharing a cell with Epstein and other people in hell so good riddance and I don't I don't expect norwan ever speak about him again anyway it's a tragedy for the people who are killed for Ted Kaczynski burn in hell I think is basically what we're saying okay let's get to our first big story
 Donald Trump makes history as the first former president to be federally indicted the former president is accused of violating seven federal laws and faces 37 separate charges related to the classified documents he took from the White House and kept at Mar-A-Lago law enforcement is preparing for unrest ahead of Trump's federal court appearance in Miami today for those keeping track it's Trump's second indictment so far this year the first was in April and New York State charges related to the stormy down this hush money payments he was also the first president Peach twice by the House of Representatives so here we are he's of course crowing and acting like he's winning he could face two more indictments this year in case it's related to his effort overturn the 2020 election there's a George investigation into election interference and then a federal investigation to Trump's role in January 6th so Biden's not saying much and obviously the justice department is doing this so he's hands off of this all the presidential candidates including any modern mention him Vivic Rama Swami he's a little toad he said
 gets electrical pardoned Trump whatever move back you're never going to let elected Chris Christian aesa Hutchinson both whom near the bottom of the polls are denouncing Trump's actions along with Bill Barr his Trump's attorney general Hutchinson won it so far it's a trump should drop out of course he won't de Santa's alien Pence all made seems essentially criticizing the justice department moves but saying it's time to pass the Trump Theater which nobody is I don't know what to say he says he's a no chance he'll drop out and he would take a plea only if they paid him which of course he's always looking for a cheap book that guy so and most Republicans are with him are with them this was so I read the indictment I look at the internment of the Japanese I look at the slaughter of Native Americans I look at the War on Drugs as a thinly veiled attempt to keep people of color down I look at I mean we have so many I look at the invasion right we have so many stains on our on the American story
 nothing matches Trump trump has diminished our standing globally for decades he is corrupt and he is visibly stupid Nixon was corrupt he was not stupid
 you know I think w
 but made the stupidest decision in in recent history but I don't think he's corrupt I actually think he's a good man
 Donald Trump is both corrupt and stupid and has brought tremendous damage to our standing around the world that will take us decades to repair
 and after reading this indictment and I didn't even see this coming I was focused I thought the case in New York was stupid I don't think America cares about paying off
 pornographers or prostitutes not for this guy not for this guy I don't think I I thought Georgia might stick but I wasn't sure after reading this indictment and then talking to a couple legal Scholars
 I remember I remember thinking you know what we got him because if you look at crimes it's the severity of the crime he was literally sharing documents with people he was sharing governmental information on security assets including agents in this data was information on a plan to invade Iran and then it goes to state of mind and this is the difference really the big difference between Hillary's emails and this hilly didn't know she was violating the law she as soon as she found out about it she was cooperated and the justice department decided in the doj decided the doj decided not to move forward he had confidential information and he's on tape bragging that it's confidential information and then sharing information about a classified potential invasion of Iran Iran with non-security clearance individuals and then and then his lawyers violate violate client
 privilege and the judge grants it to them because he has enlisted them in their corruption
 I mean the legal Scholars the two legal Scholars I talked took me through everything here and after listening to him I'm like oh my God we got them
 and the laws are very severe here correct there's a couple of things obviously the judge is back at that cookie judge from Florida Eileen Cannon which was worrisome to be able to chill drag it out that's one two he's trying to argue it's the presidential records Act was should have been applied here and it's it's like a he should get a hand slap for doing what he did now again Bill Barr of all people put a very cogent argument he's like had he had he had them and then he gave them back the presidential record act would apply he just gets to return them but he kept lying to return them he wouldn't tell he the amount of stuff he took the the level of security that he didn't honor and that he and that he lied to he constantly lied in face of Sabinas bilbar was like he's toast he was like he's toast there's a cover-up yeah but still still all these Republicans are going for it with him like saying it's no big deal Hillary Hillary Hillary Joe Biden Mike Pence apparently should have gone to jail they all should have gone to jail if Trump is going to Grand I have
 yes I feel like the worm is turning even the Republicans I think their language is changing you have Republican candidates now for the first time saying he should draw from the race I look at the end of the day it's important what those folks say in terms of legal opinion but every legal scholar I've talked to is like oh God he's fucked
 here do you remember that scene where Carl says to Tom well let's just break it down you're seen as a blundering interloper and he's like you are fair and squarely fucked
 after spending some time looking at this thing and by the way the daily from The New York Times
 defines
 incredible news and journalism done in this format I listen to their podcast on this they are they doing outstanding job I felt so much better educated and I thought they were balanced and thoughtful but on several Dimensions here he not only broke the law he did it so blatantly and was so stupid and tried to cover it up and left and left irrefutable evidence
 every step of the way
 people are still nerve-racked about it because he's going to continue to fight he's pushing back he's being as obtuse and difficult as ever it's also a major test for social media with lots of trump backers escalating the rhetoric Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs tweeted we now have reached a War Phase eye for an eye Carrie Lake that that showed his Harpy put up a video on Facebook Twitter and Instagram saying essentially if we want to get Trump you're gonna have to go through me and my 75 million other Americans many of whom are NRA members I guess she was making a gun reference Carey who you're scare me you scare me Carrie we're gonna have to go through a fox host from the local station Arizona well that's that's literally the the shortest curb and history you know I could take her down in one punch in any case Senator Mark Warner is calling on platforms to enforce their terms of service here saying it's quote deeply concerned as he calls for political violence and response you know Twitter is not going to do anything so that's let's just take that off but you know there's escalating violence and so that's how these people work they don't have an argument they start to
 which or shoot really it'll be interesting to see if he goes on he starts using Twitter or the others more he's has truth social I guess and gets out enough I have close friends or Ricardo sagroff another llamas Orlando Marchant from El Salvador Venezuela
 and they're an alternative Investments came to America went to business school here stayed here and all of them said something that was really Illuminating for me they said you don't appreciate as a citizen how powerful the rule of law is here
 that everyone is subject to it and everyone gets a fair Shake in terms of Defense he said in the countries we come to the wrong call has made and people show up and take all your shit away or worse and you don't have defense you don't have rights private property it's not respected he said you Americans just don't and the reason why any stock that goes public in America trades in a much higher multiple is because there is rule of law and respect for private property and one set of laws that apply to everybody I think the law is going to take over here I really do I think that the violations here are the legal
 the criminality here and the the statutes of violates are so clear and also America takes very seriously it's as it should it's nuclear secrets I don't think you can get out of this one
 he's very he's very life in that regard he's overweight and stumbling but he tends to get out of things because he's so greasy because he's not taking those Tango classes you sexy mink salsa so I almost took Bachata but we took salsa you don't know the difference Bachata it's a slower salsa kind of something I think one two three four five six seven you and I should take salsa lessons together we would look like Ichabod Crane and ervey Village taking dance classes it would look so fucking ridiculous I got it it'd be it'd be good on tiktok yeah but it would be in the Muff report which is my favorite follow I say that we have that come up with a tiktok scheme so that might be one of the ways we go anyway president Trump we hope all bad things happen to you in this regard we hope you go to jail and they throw away the key they're not gonna do that but nonetheless all right Scott let's go on a quick break we come back Tesla's autopilot has been involved in more crashes and previously reported and why doesn't the government do a better job of using technology provide basic services our friend a pivot Jennifer polka joins us to explain

 Tesla's got its very own set of wins and fails this week for the wind Tesla struck agreements with GM and Ford that will let their EV owners access Tesla superchargers around the country Tesla has the largest charger Network in the country who is 17,000 plugs they tend to be faster more reliable and more conveniently located than their competitors the new deals give GM and Ford ev's access to 12,000 Tesla plugs that means Tesla's North American charging standard will control nearly three quarters of the EV Market in the US this is a win they were very pressy and about putting these in obviously you have to if you want people not to have distance it's distance fear whatever there's a word for it it will qualify for some five billion dollars in federal funding Mark for public charging infrastructure plus more Revenue as Ford and GM customers pay to charge up although it's a very low margin business eventually GM and Ford could win because they get double to charge your access and then what happens to these non Tesla charging systems there's lots of lots of competitors evgo there's a whole
 lunch I would assume everyone will have to adopt the Tesla's standard at least in the United States but I'm not sure what do you think about that part and then we'll get to the second part
 you know a guy I don't think there's any getting around it I think it's a huge Victory a huge win for Tesla because effectively there now the iOS the operating system are kind of the equivalent the analog I think would be the App Store where everybody who shows up to their charger
 and after a staggering investment by them I'm not saying they haven't earned it but it's gonna have to comply to their format and at some point I would imagine Tesla's gonna figure out a way to impose economic or non-economic taxes on everybody that wants to operate on instead of iOS you know Tesla OS which is their charging of the structure and there's not getting around it I think it's a huge victory for Tesla yeah it's like so someone's comparing to Sony versus betamax like ultimately and video cassettes and it is it is it's a really good thing I always thought they were very pressing about this they this is an important part of they identified the issue of people being scared of being between charges you get now around 300 miles sometimes they go a little less or more depending on how you use the car the weather and this and that but some of them are getting up to 500 the loose that I think is up to 500 though probably comes in below that and so this is a good thing this is a very good thing and everyone will have to dance to in this area probably we do need one standard the gas stations and everything else it doesn't
 this is the way it goes everywhere eventually it is a low margin business eventually it's not like the App Store precisely because I think I think ultimately they'll be copycats etc etc so we'll see we'll see it's a good thing we like this we like this Elon for sure let's move to the bad Tesla news though a new Washington Post report revealed that Tesla's autopilot has been involved in Far More crashes than previously reported autopilot has been involved in 736 accidents and 17 fatalities since 2019 that's according to analysis of the national highway traffic traffic safety administration data eleven of the 17 fatal accidents have happened since last May one expert says Elon Musk decision to expand the rollout of full service driving maybe to blame for the increase in the accident numbers NH TSA has been active investigation to test autopilot including full self-driving another detail in the report the global computer shortage let Elon Musk to push for cost saving measures in 2021 was a Tesla to get rid of a radar sensors this is a big deal among having just interviewed a lot of autopilot people they find it
 is some that he doesn't have more points of points of view along these cars most cars have applied our radar cameras Etc he only has one one or two one I think the post says former Tesla employees leadership I played a role in pushing technology out to the public for it was ready back in February Tesla shareholders fight a lawsuit accusing Elon and Tesla of older stating the safety of autopilot and self-driving he argues the long term benefits of rolling at the technology to drivers means technology learns faster he does have a point waymo and apple on the other hand reporterly set strict rules around how their technology learns that is absolutely true I just spent some time with them so thoughts again sloppy and doesn't care about people dying there's two things here at the sort of big Tech mentality of move fast and break things even if it
 hurts the country or hurts people you know there's definitely something there where it's uncomfortable in should be looked at the question I would have is that driving is dangerous I went to a big high school University High School in West Los Angeles and we used on a regular basis show up and you know you walk through the front of the school where all the trophies are and on a regular basis when I was a in high school there'd be a memorial there'd be you know a thing with a picture of a kid and flowers you know like oh fuck because you know what it was and it was someone who had been killed and almost always it was the same thing it was a drunk driving accident
 we don't have airbags we didn't have collapsible steering wheel shafts you know non-shatterproof and we didn't have public transportation in La we also didn't have the education for Mothers Against Drunk Driving and we used to get I'm not proud of this we see a ridiculously fucked up and take to the roads of Los Angeles and kids were getting killed all the time cards have gone way down way down because of Education around alcohol and driving and because of airbags they're much safer but still it's a long winded way of getting to I would just want to see it adjusted for a number of trips relative to number of trips in non autonomous driving fatalities yeah absolutely I was gonna make that point yeah I mean obviously humans are more fatal it's just this is one of the complaints I heard especially author record from the other competitors is like he's messing it up for all of us because we do are aware of these problems and they're gonna happen but sloppiness makes it worse right sloppiness
 not caring and pushing it through you've got to have some semblance of caring about safety at least if not actually caring about safety and I think one of the problems is the rushing it out too quickly on something that's gets tons of it now look it's 17 accidents versus probably hundreds of accidents and not maybe thousands of accidents in the same time and crashes at the same time this is this is under scrutiny and therefore is going to be under Regulatory regimes and things like that and the slopier they are in Rolling these things out the worst it's gonna be even if these accidents are not they I mean I feel terrible for the 17 people who die but it's it's going to be it's gonna be under much more scrutiny and so being sloppy about it seems not the way to go and I know that most of the others are sort of like this guy like this guy this guy that keeps fucking up for the rest of us even though he's obviously the Pioneer here
 what I don't understand is why they didn't start it strikes me that autonomous driving goes hand in glove for
 Trucking Long Haul Trucking late at night when they're just no other people or cars to hit
 I would I I'm it's I'm befuddled as to why they wouldn't start there and then move into consumer they are I I literally just didn't interview with the with Aurora other that's where they're starting because in my Tesla you could do autonomous driving mode or whatever it was and I found it very uncomfortable
 but anyways it just needs to be adjusted for I do think Innovation comes at a cost and I would just like to see the numbers adjusted relative to people who are driving just you know not I think the thing is that they don't reveal it right they're not they're just playing a little fast and loose and the other makers think it's a problem because it's going to it's gonna have down Downstream effects for them because they'll be lumped in with sort of more sloppy Behavior or yelling at the government they don't particularly want to yell at the government not to defend Elon but it was because of Elon that the market exists that's correct that's correct I get it but you still don't want someone like running around screaming at the government it's a very Travis kalanic way of Behaving and so you're gonna have these issues as you move forward there's certainly a lot less dangerous than people but you're still going to get a scrutiny and so I think it's incumbent on the people doing it to be extra safe and extra respectful of the problems they have even as they're learning them and everybody knows that once you get them out there the longer term benefits are greater because the technology learns and that is
 100% true but we'll say but we like the Chargers maybe be a little more careful Elon on the on the accidents let's bring in our friend of pivot
 Jennifer Parker served as deputy chief technology officer in the Obama White House and is the founder of code for America a nonprofit that works to improve government Digital Services she's written a new book called recoding america-wide government is failing in the digital age and how we can do better welcome Jennifer
 thanks for having me it's good to see you so talk a little bit about this problem this has been problem we've talked about for years if you're signing up for anything the public digital infrastructure is long been far behind the private sector talk to you about why that is because as you know technology moves forward and people are used to using these things it's unusual the government is now it's gotten better but it's certainly not caught up to the way we behave in our private lives
 yeah and I think a lot of people look at that and they say oh wow we've really got to get these platforms onto the cloud or we just need the better programmers to come from the private sector
 but I wrote the book because I think it's kind of a deeper problem than that and I wanted people to understand it you know good example would be the clearing the criminal records this is a project that we did at code for America still going on where you know if we had all these states that have decriminalized marijuana and as part of that
 the people who had a criminal record should have it taken off they don't need to be living under the cloud of a felony anymore but the process to get it off was like you know a year long of like Gathering data and information from the government filling out really complicated forms and then sending something into like various different government offices and waiting for your truck your your court date and then you know if you get that then you have to go back to all these offices so like nobody got their expungement and I think a lot of people look at something like that and they say okay this process has to been designed to be hard for people we must not want them to get those records expunged
 but I think that deeper problem is that like it hasn't really been designed at all these are process that sort of accumulated or are created over time and it's been no one's job to go back and look at them and say wait a minute these are just records in a database there's a database somewhere that says this is a felony we can find all the ones that are eligible and we can change them and you know it's it's really got to be someone's job to actively design these services that work for people one of the hard things is besides money and we'll get to that in a second you describe the outdated technology that's in use some systems are using COBOL which is a 60 year old program language the IRS has been playing to update one of its core systems for the past 23 years talk about why it's difficult for government to make Pace there's so much great software out there or make updates
 well because we don't just go update stuff in government we have these really complex processes and the processes have to do with going and finding all the possible requirements that anybody could think of I mean really everyone can think of they all get to pile them all on
 that takes several years it can take a decade and it has in many cases then they did that out to a vendor and that can take a couple years and then they have often you know a couple to 10 to 15 years to build it all and by the time they do all that
 software that they're going to get back is you know by definition wildly outdated so that it's not just that we you know it's not just that we don't do it right it's that we have these processes that often Force us to do it wrong now of course there are great public servants who are getting the right outcomes there but you know I think about this guy who I met when I was working in the White House who was at the Department of Veterans Affairs who had some software that just really didn't work for processing veterans claims and I was asking him about you know hey why is it do this or why did you make this choice and he kept saying that's not my call I don't have an opinion on the business requirements and in fact I teach my staff not to have an opinion on the business requirements
 if they asked me to build a concrete boat I'm going to build a concrete boat
 and you know that's that's where we how we get there is that we have these processes that build concrete boats and they don't float
 nice to meet you when you look at the landscape of where government intersects with technology whether it's
 figuring out better record storage for healthcare or access to broadband for long-term neighborhoods or figuring out maybe some sort of
 a digital currency backed by the US government where would you say the lowest hanging fruit is for the government to get behind a certain technology I think that it is not about a certain technology that we should get behind I think it's about
 really in the end of the day empowering public servants to user judgment we actually have great people in government and they don't they're sometimes blocked from updating our technology because they're told to do a very very specific thing instead of to make it work so we have this whole infrastructure that's about Fidelity to process instead of getting the outcomes that we need and I just think that there's not a particular technology that's going to save us until we have a different approach and we're supporting smart public servants to like do the right thing I think most people would agree that that's a cultural issue and the US government with its resources and it's mandate and it's Talent
 could use it you know an improvement in culture to kind of get things done but if if that were to happen where do you think the biggest opportunity is where we would realize a better Commonwealth oh that's a good question I mean in general I think there it's hard to answer because everything feels like an existential threat these days but ultimately you know when people have bad experiences with government services particularly means tested benefits where this whole apparatus of let everybody pile everything on so you get for instance and in supplemental nutrition assistance it's like the form that we were looking at in California had 212 questions and a bunch of them were like not only confusing but kind of insulting like assumed that you were drug dealer assumed that you had traded your SNAP benefits for ammunition or guns you know people have these bad experiences and then they vote at lower rates this has been shown through through research
 I think that alienation that we see when people are frustrated I mean you don't have doesn't have to be mean tested benefits it can be like filing your taxes I did this with my my 20 year old daughter last year trying to actually file her like taxes that should have been really simple and I just wanted to tear my hair out so you get this frustration with government that carries over to your feelings about voting and Civic engagement and democracy
 and that is such a threat to the country that we need to have right now we need people who believe in government want to get involved you know that are actually voting in elections especially those who are the people who need these government services the most
 does the quality of service have to do with the user base you
 impulse of coming upstairs veterans benefits so far you mentioned this California's SNAP program these are food benefits is that one of the problems is it's the people they don't care much about so why not just make it more difficult for them
 I think that there's simply more neglect
 in these areas where there's sort of not a constituency with a powerful voice there's a lot of cases where it really isn't in my mind primarily intentional it is in some cases absolutely intentional you look at Social Security I actually probably should admit this I manage my grandmother's social security for her online like I use login.gov and I go check her stuff and make sure she's you know getting her checks and manage her finances it's really easy Social Security is great they have a really powerful constituency people understand it for them but it's also because we've had really good people at Social Security making this good for like you know 15 years they've been working on their digital it's been great
 so it just depends on the agency and nothing's directed from the center correct like it just depends on on where they're from but which agency it comes from it's both I think having a powerful constituency saying this has to be good helps a lot
 but yes it can also just be you know the agencies that have had the power to figure it out a little bit better
 or they get a lot of negative attention like with Obamacare signing up for that that was a big deal when that didn't roll out which is probably during your time correct yeah I happen to be there it was sort of the reason in the end of the day that we were able to stand up the United States digital service was that we've been trying and there wasn't a clear enough reason to have it happen until healthcare.gov fell over but that's another really good example of how that Dynamic can happen in agencies so I tell in the book The Story of a career public servant who was at centers for medicated Medicare Services which CMS that's the agency that had to implement the ACA in the form of healthcare.gov
 she was really well respected and so she was pulled into helping fix healthcare.gov but then after that she really wanted to show that the agency could do better and she gets thrown you know the next big law that comes down from Congress it was called macra doesn't really matter what it stands for and she really decides she's gonna do this right and I think the story of what she has to fight against to get the role out of macra to be the exact opposite of the role of healthcare.gov like in the end when they launched this doctors are delighted like they're they have braced call Center for you know all the complaints that doctors are gonna call in with because they always do whenever there's a change to one of these things and instead people are calling and going oh my God this is so easy there must be something wrong my own the wrong website but the how she got there was not like okay it's now in the cloud or like I got better programmers that of course those two things were true it's that she got handed
 relations that we're going to make it impossible to be good and said wait a minute that's not going to work you're gonna have to talk to me about this we're gonna have to change it so you know early example exercise is one of her colleagues from the United States digital service they say okay well the first thing that doctors have to do is choose are you a sole practitioner or are you in a group practice and they're like oh by the way there are nine different definitions of a group practice right right well you know and and most digital teams in government will just say oh okay I guess I have to code all that in and these guys said no that's not gonna work like we can't make something that makes sense to people unless we can consolidate some of these definitions and she had a whole bunch of other things like that where she really stood up for a service that would work so often a single person right it's often a single person who does these things well she will tell you it absolutely wasn't a single person I I like to call her out because I think she's an incredible leader that a lot of people talk about but she will tell you it's a team of people who support each other she's a really great
 let's give credit for that let's talk about long and short-term Solutions are there any short-term Solutions whatsoever
 I'm in the short term I think the biggest thing we could do is like force government to be able to hire people more quickly we've got so many amazing technologists who want to go work in government and it takes nine months to get them hired and there's a stuff that that the agencies could do there's stuff that Congress could do and there's stuff that the average American could do to ask their representatives to fix this so are there a lot that want to get into it or is that's always been the push is that they could go into companies and make more money although there's been layoffs that those places there might be more opportunity for good staffers well even before the layoffs we were starting to see a lot of people sort of disillusioned with tech who were saying you know is this really how I want to spend my life like I could be helping yeah people get their food benefits I could be helping refugees come into this country like the the mission is actually super super compelling we did have trouble getting people in
 in the beginning but once they see it and they see what they can do they kind of really want to help and now we have more people than not more people than we can use but more people than we can get through the system right now and they're really good people
 a lot of what we've been talking about is kind of cultural issues and some of that comes down to we've talked about the end user and Technology but a lot of it is the people that go to work in government
 and as someone who teaches kids at an elite University I see a lot of very impressive kids go into the armed services
 a lot of kids decide that they want to go make a shit ton of money and then run for elected office but you don't see a lot of impressive kids thinking I want to go to work in government just said kind of a field level
 what do we need to do to you know create a better Pathways or make working for the US government more attractive to younger talented people well I do think that's changing I have a stat from Stanford in the book actually I don't remember the exact stat but
 yes if you look overall there's not as many kids coming at a stand for we want to go to government but like if you slice it by what they say is most important to them if it's making money no they're not going to go but if you look at those who said Mission as their number one thing they want to do they're just proportionately wanting to go into government so I think we may be getting some of the right kids do we need more yes and to make it more attractive I think they have to understand the impact they can have and then I mean it's not just that they don't think they're going to make as much money I mean I think a lot of people who do this will tell you they're happy people even though it's really frustrating because they feel like it's really meaningful work
 but the basic stuff of like even if you want to do it and you get stuck in a nine month hiring process and in Along Comes like BCG or vacancy gives you an offer You're Gonna Take You may just take it because you can't wait nine months so there's some really basic stuff that we can do to fix the hiring pipeline to fix how Civil Service works that I think would just I know it sounds really basic but would go a long way to getting these folks in let me ask you so what's the longer term solution I think the longer term solution is we have to have like a political constituency behind What I Call State capacity you know can government do what it's supposed to do
 what we decide to do together like can we actually execute on it so I think most way when we think about like our Civic roles in life it's like we're
 we're gunning for a particular policy that we want past and that's great we should be but if we're not also or at least equally obsessed with can the government deliver on that policy once it's passed we're just going to stay stuck in this place it's just like the wheels just Spin and so I think people have to think differently we have to push our elected leaders to think differently and really focus on and also I'd say philanthropy like philanthropy is constantly pushing for policy change but not funding the state capacity to have that policy change mean anything right right and then people have just respect for the government there's not working so are there any opportunities for AI or you thinking about this are you optimistic about how the government could use it or concerned
 are both yeah and then I think like everybody I'm I'm both so I'll tell you I was hanging out the other day as one does at the New Jersey Department of Labor and there's a fantastic team there that's really making unemployment insurance work a lot better and we know how hard that was for all the states but like one little thing I saw was this designer he's done a lot of work on a different benefits over over the years and she had been in the process of helping New Jersey redesign all the notices the people get so like you apply you get an email you get letters all these things are really confusing and if you've ever gotten one of these things you write them in you're like what does this say I just got one from the IRS I don't understand so you don't know what it means so she is like a genius at rewriting these things so that you know what you're supposed to do when you get damn letter and she'd been going through them at a certain pace and then chat GPT came out and she just started feeding the letters into chat GPT with the prompt
 Rick can you rewrite this so I can understand it better now she didn't then like go publish that like she took it to the policy team like she always does and said how much of this is right how much of this is wrong and but they were getting through these redesigns I mean they're rewrites and redesigns like I don't know way faster rate stuff that's very easy to explain that they can't get wrong does tend to work really well in these environments that makes total sense so I call that like under the banner of
 this is like a line from the book it has to make sense to a person this is what the teams that are fighting their sort of overly complex policy and procedure requirements say like I get that it's complicated it has to make sense to a person so this is a way in which AI can help
 government services make sense to a person now the flip side of it is
 yes AI can take super complex stuff and make sense of it but we shouldn't use that as an excuse not to simplify the stuff so can I give you one story about how complicated this stuff is so when I was working in California on clearing this backlog of 1.2 million unpaid unemployment insurance claims and like July August September 2020 sort of the height of the pandemic craziness at a colleague who's working with these claims processors sort of day by day side by side asking them questions so she could figure out like where we were stuck and one of these people kept saying to her I'm not quite sure about the answer that question I'm the new guy and finally she was like okay you told me the new guy like 10 times how long have you been here and he said I've been here 17 years
 and so the people who really know how this stuff works have been here 25 years or longer so that's why we couldn't clear it is you only had this many claims processor so like 40% of the claims had to go through and experience claims processors and you could not manufacture new ones for 25 years so every
 staff member that they hired supposedly the health the claims processors were just distracting the claims processors so their solution had been higher 5,000 staff we were able to show that every staff they hired slowed claims processing
 and the core problem is that it takes 25 years to learn this stuff
 so if we then say okay great I mean in the short term could we have used some really great AI to clear yes sure in the short term Absolutely I'll take it let's get those 1.2 million claims cleared in the long term though if we say oh we don't have to resolve this problem of this
 policy complexity this is just staggering we're just gonna let that you can't just leave that there like that has to be addressed and I am afraid people are going to say oh it's okay we don't have to deal with that now now we have ai yeah absolutely all right Jennifer's new book is called recoding America why government is failing in the digital age and how we can do better reviews are saying it should be quote required reading for politicians and policy makers I don't I'm not sure they read anymore Jennifer but we really appreciate no but their staff read and they can tell them what it said all right okay all right you're so positive you're always so positive anyway thank you so much thank you this is great appreciate it thanks Jennifer nice to meet you all right Scott one more quick break we'll be back for wins and fails

 okay Scott we're back for wins and fails I am going to go first Scott do you mind
 of course not okay Fred Ryan the publisher and chief executive of the Washington Post just announced he's departing in August been under a lot of pressure he's been in the position for most of the Decades since Jeff Bezos bought the post stepping into the interim CEO role immediately is Patti Stone Cipher a founding chief executive The Gates Foundation and more recently director of on the Amazon board she'll lead the search for Ryan's replacement Patty is fantastic she's married to Michael Kinsley by the way for people don't know great journalist very good news for the people of the post I think there was a lot of frustration with Fred I like Fred personally but he was he was there was a lot of he was in the way of a lot of change I think that needed to happen and Patty is really top level top shelf I've known her from very beginning of Microsoft and so that'll be great that'll be that'll be an interesting transition I doubt she would stay in the full role so it's not really her area of expertise but she certainly knows how to run things again she was a big Microsoft executive too at Microsoft so a really good good news for the Washington Post
 think over time that Jeff has done something he obviously knew he had heard from a lot of reporters who might have talked to too who said that change had to come and it had to come at the publishing level I guess my fail my fail and what is my fail this Trump noise it's the idea of violence is so repulsive so I guess my fail is really terrible terrible people like Carrie Lake who are doing that and think it's cute and for political means there there Paper Tigers and I wish someone would throw water upon them so they would melt away just people that carry like should melt
 anyway that's my fail so 25 years ago when I moved to New York I kept getting set up on dates which is a great thing and I was set up with this really impressive intelligent woman for lunch at
 was it called kef oh God it was that next to the Morgan Library it was it had a moment anyways and had a really lovely lunch with this woman and I don't think either of us could figure out if we'd been set up or it was a date we had a really nice lunch but I was traveling all the time she was traveling all the time we never saw each other again you know that was
 no who
 Patty Stone Cipher whoa you're kidding yeah like a quarter century ago wow and then she married a really high quality man but go ahead that's not nice
 I love Michael Kinsley so much I I could be hosting all these highbrow cocktail parties in DC I could be the total Lady of DC oh my God anyways see seemed like a really lovely person super impressive she is um okay Winston fails my it's not a fail but most both of them have to do with football I've been thinking a lot about when I was a younger dad I was really excited to get my kids into CrossFit and World War Two history and Aviation and all the shit that I'm interested in
 and what you realize is that if you want if you want your if you want to be you know go from being an okay Dad do a good dad and maybe someday aspire to be a great dad your job is not to get your kids interested in what you do your job is to develop their interests and then you get into their interest and that's what I have found it's been a real unlock for me and well I have absolutely no interest in professional sports none whatsoever sound like you do you go on and on about it now it's interesting good and the reason why yeah your kids is because my sons are into it and I'm into my sons and I'm into shared experiences with my sons that will remember the rest of our lives I would never go to a football match had I not had kids it's just not my thing but here's the thing the the fun and the joy of man and Dad
 as you go to this stuff and you you know I don't watch the football game I watch for something to happen and then I watched their reaction that's the moment right and my advice to fathers under the auspices of my virtue signaling moment is the real joy in in fatherhood is finding shit that they're really into and then bringing it out in them and then sharing it with them and I can't tell you
 just I mean we went to this game and I said I said to my son this is your day we'll do whatever you want the game started at 10 pm because they want to broadcast it for us and Western European cities so they start the game at 10 pm you know what time we left for the stadium no we left for the stadium at 4:30 we were there four hours walking around the village finding different things to do buying jerseys trying different desserts and different I mean he's just so into it and then do you know what time we left the stadium two in the morning 1:30 he wanted to stay for an hour and a half and that then that's just so amazing about Premier League in European football Inter Milan lost the game you know how many other fans were there 90 minutes after the game had ended
 every damn one of them I mean these fans are Just So Graceful and in into their team I mean the whole that Stadium holds like 80,000 people I bet 90 minutes after the whistle had been called 70,000 were still there but anyways my my fail or when or whatever you want to call it is an unlock take it for me dads find the shit your kid is interested in and it's your job to get into that not vice versa that is really nice Scott and it also by the way the wind really is petty stonecipher didn't marry you but Patty
 good for she dodged a bullet that's talk about dodging the mother of all bullets um when we were at the restaurant site that people were around for Pride this weekend it was a Pride weekend in Washington and his dad who I thought looked like like a Trumper I don't know why he just did you know what I mean like he he looked like that and he walked in he was wearing Pride stuff on his shirt and his son was with him who was younger but seemed gay to me you know what I mean like and was all excited was holding all this Pride stuff and and it was really nice he was he they had just been a pride he took his son and I thought oh I should not assume anything and I felt very good about that and I'm sure I don't want to go to Pride and I'm always and I'm gay but I thought that was really nice that the parents of two parents were with the son who I'm suspecting that's who they were supporting during this and it was really nice it was nice to see anyway that's very good Scott what do you have a fail you have a fail so my next one is Antonella recuso I hope I'm getting that
 right but essentially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been just buying amazing athletes they just basically took over the PGA they got Benzema and Ronaldo two of the great figures in the history of football they paid Ronaldo
 at the age of 38 400 million dollars to come play in the kingdom and recently the biggest news in sport was that Lionel Messi who's probably the best active football player in the world you know he's probably the best and Bape is probably gonna be the next best but anyways this guy is fantastic a Class Act won the World Cup greatest game in history and he could have got probably six to 800 million and he chose inter Miami he's going to the Miami team I mean it's just Miami is such an amazing City and I can tell you the reason you know when Ronaldo who took 400 million dollars and and lives has to spend half his year in in the Kingdom which I enjoyed going but it's no Miami when he comes and visits his buddy Massey and in South Beach he's gonna think I fucked up because these guys have enough money that's not it they're not gonna want more money they're gonna want five years back in terms of where they live I'm gonna bet the Lionel Messi came home and said we got
 this is offered a 600 million and she said Lionel we're moving to Miami yeah because to raise our kids our three boys who are school-age boys we're still young it's a live in Miami for the next five years
 is gonna be an amazing experience that is true except for the rest of Florida I just so you know there were two dozen white supremacist protesting outside of Disney this weekend but you know whatever that state is so fucked up you just had to do that didn't you anyways answer Miami at Miami and Antonella recusa they made an amazing decision here this is a huge one Miami wins culture really robust amazing beaches ridiculously fucking hot people Aladdin Vibe a thriving LGBT community amazing weather Miami book Banning it's a fantastic state to live in I'm talking about Miami I know I know Miami is the winner here
 and I'm gonna bet I'm gonna bet that they have the same relationship that a lot of couples have and then on the really important stuff mom has a better Instinct around this stuff I'm gonna bet that Antonella made this decision and you know what she's my win she made the right decision now you're going now you got to go back to Florida don't you welcome to enter Miami Antonella and Lionel this is gonna be the one of the best decisions you have ever made you are gonna have a wonderful life when are you moving back to the Florida coast
 oh gosh I don't know is that you're a serious question yeah
 my son's in high school and thriving so we're here until he's out of high school all right okay you love that Florida that's all you just love that love it always absolutely love love the lifestyle love it okay Scott that's enough we want to hear from you our listeners send us your questions about business Tech or whatever's on your mind go to nymag.com/pivot to submit a question for the show or call 8551 pivot Scott that's the show we'll be back on Friday for more read us out Today's show was produced by Laura Naman and Taylor Griffin Ernie Andrew Todd engineered this episode thanks also to Drew Burrows and Silverio make sure you're subscribe to the new show wherever you listen to podcast thank you for listening to Pivot from New York Magazine a box media we'll be back later this week for another breakdown of all things Tech in business hello Messi
